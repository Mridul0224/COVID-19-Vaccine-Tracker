# Global COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker

## Overview

This repository hosts the Global COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker, a project aimed at providing insights into the global vaccination rollout to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the challenges, vaccination remains one of the most effective ways to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. However, the progress of vaccination programs varies significantly across different regions. This project offers a detailed view of the global efforts to vaccinate populations, tracking the speed and scale of these efforts on a daily basis.

## Situation

The COVID-19 pandemic has been a defining global health crisis, affecting millions worldwide. Vaccination has emerged as a key strategy in the fight against the pandemic, yet its rollout has been uneven globally. This project aims to shed light on these disparities, offering a comprehensive look at the progress toward vaccination across countries.

## Task

As the lead data analyst, my role involved the design and implementation of an interactive dashboard to track key metrics of the global vaccination effort. This dashboard was developed using Tableau, a leading tool for data visualization, to enable real-time exploration of vaccination data.

## Action

The dashboard was created with data from the Our World in Data COVID vaccination dataset, which compiles the latest official figures from governments and health ministries worldwide. It features key indicators such as the proportion of the population partially or fully vaccinated, daily vaccine doses administered, daily booster doses, and the correlation between GDP and vaccination program performance. It also includes interactive map charts and filters for date, country, and continent.

## Result

This dashboard has proven to be an invaluable resource for policymakers, researchers, and the public, aiding in the tracking of vaccination progress and identifying areas in need of more resources. Notable outcomes of the project include:

- Enhanced transparency and accountability in vaccination efforts globally.
- Improved coordination among entities fighting the pandemic.
- Expedited advancement toward herd immunity in numerous countries.

## Reflection

The project underscored the critical role of data visualization in conveying complex information effectively. It also highlighted the power of teamwork and collaboration in achieving project objectives. Future enhancements will focus on integrating more real-time data sources and enhancing the dashboard's user experience.
